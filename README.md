# Tetragon

**_COMING SOON_**

Ciliumâ€™s new **Tetragon** component enables powerful, **eBPF-based Security Observability and Runtime Enforcement**. 

Tetragon detects and is able to respond in real time to security-significant events, such as

* Process execution events
* Changes to privileges and capabilities 
* I/O activity including network & file access

When used in a Kubernetes environment, Tetragon is Kubernetes-aware - that is, it understands Kubernetes identities such as namespaces, pods and so-on - so that security event detection can be configured in relation to individual workloads.
